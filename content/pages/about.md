I am a Machine Learning team leader at [coveo](http://coveo.com), currently interested in recommender systems. I completed a Ph.D. in Machine Learning at Université Laval under the supervision of François Laviolette and Mario Marchand, where I developed PAC-Bayesian bounds over risk of majority vote classifiers, together with learning algorithms inspired by these bounds.

See my Publications page for more information about my work.
